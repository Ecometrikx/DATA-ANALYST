The files in this repository are free and publicly available 'RAW' data sets. 
I have used these to train and practice to become a Data Analyst while following a Data Analyst Bootcamp on YouTube created by AlexTheAnalyst.
These files have been really helpful while diving into the use of SQL, Excel, Tableau, PowerBI or Python.
Suitable for all levels, beginner-intermediate-advanced.
