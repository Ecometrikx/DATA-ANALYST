The files in this repository are free and publicly available 'RAW' data sets of which some can be found on kaggle.com. 
I have used these to train and practice to become a Data Analyst while following a Data Analyst boot camp on YouTube created by AlexTheAnalyst.
These files have been beneficial when diving into SQL, Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, Pandas and Python.
Suitable for all levels, beginner-intermediate-advanced.
